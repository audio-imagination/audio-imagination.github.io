# Call For Papers
## Main paper track
We will invite researchers to submit papers focusing on, but not limited to, the following topics related to audio generation:

- Textual prompts and natural language inputs based generation and editing of audio, such as text-to-speech (i.e., speech synthesis), and text-to-music and text-to-sound, where text prompts are used to describe what signals to generate.
- Multimodal generation of audio - going beyond text to visual, acoustic and other forms of inputs. Generating audio that is synchronized with the video.
- Relationship with and impact of generative AI techniques on established speech/audio/music tasks where audio is generated such as speech enhancement, source separation, voice conversion, speech to speech translation, to mention a few. 
- Generation of spatial audio and experiences driven by spatial audio.
- Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR), where, for example, spatial awareness of sound objects needs to be realistic, and generated signals need to be aligned with other modalities such as visual cues.
- Impact of generative audio on content creators - we aim to invite content creators to share their experiences and insights on how generative AI models could impact their productivity and unlock their creativity.
- Interpretability in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
- Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
- Novel applications of generative AI in audio/speech/music.
- Connection of audio generation with language generation, including similarities and differences.

## Demo Session
A key component of the proposed workshop is that we will hold an onsite demo session, where participants can have a unique chance to showcase their advanced audio, speech, and music generation technologies, in addition to sharing their academic findings through talks and posters.
- Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to also have a demo of their generation method during their paper presentation
- Researchers can submite a 3-page submission outlining details of their demo to a separate demo track.
