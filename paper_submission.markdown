# Paper Submission

Audio Imagination Workshop at Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) is aimed at bringing together researchers working in the area of generative AI for audio, speech, music including multimodal generative AI with audio as one of the modality. 

We invite researchers to submit to submit papers focusing on, but not limited to, the following topics related to audio generation

* Textual prompts and natural language inputs based generation and editing of audio, such as text-to-speech (i.e., speech synthesis), text-to-music and text-to-sound
* Audio/Speech in LLMs/Multimodal LLMs
* Connection of audio generation with text generation, including similarities and differences.
* Video to Audio/Speech/Music Generation
* Multimodal generation of audio - going beyond unimodal inputs (text/video/audio) to audio — using multiple modalities for generating audio
* Data for audio/speech/music generative AI 
* Generative methods for and it’s impact on established speech tasks such as speech enhancement, source separation, voice conversion, speech to speech translation, to mention a few
* Generation of spatial audio and experiences driven by spatial audio.
* Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR)
* Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals
* Impact of generative audio on media and content creation technologies
* Interpretability in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
* Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
* Novel applications of audio/speech/music generation




We invite submission in two tracks, Main Paper Track and Demo Track. 


## Main paper track

The main paper track  is the primary paper submission track at the Audio Imagination workshop and will help drive discussions on topics relevant to the workshop. Papers accepted in the main paper track are expected to be presented through oral talks or poster presentations at the workshop. 

Please do not submit papers already previously published at any other conference/journal. Extension (minor or major) of previously accepted/published works are welcome. We especially encourage and welcome papers discussing interesting early promising research and/or preliminary results. NeurIPS 2024 submissions can be submitted to the workshop. However, if the paper is accepted by NeurIPS, please withdraw your paper or it will be rejected by the workshop, as it cannot be presented at the workshop. 

Authors of papers accepted at Audio Imagination can submit their paper at another conference/journal provided the other conference/journal allows it. Please note that, authors are responsible for ensuring that they meet submission policy of any other conference/journal. 


Papers submitted in the Main Paper Track

* Should be in NeurIPS 2024 format.  Please find Latex Style Files and Other Formatting Instructions [here](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers)
* Up to a max of 5 pages of content, including all figures and tables.  
* Should be double blind as per NeurIPS policy.
