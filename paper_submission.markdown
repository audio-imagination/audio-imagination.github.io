# Paper Submission

The Audio Imagination Workshop at the Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) aims to bring together researchers working in the field of generative AI for audio, speech, music, including multimodal generative AI with audio as one of the modalities.

We invite researchers to submit papers focusing on, but not limited to, the following topics related to audio generation:

* Textual prompts and natural language inputs based generation and editing of audio, such as text-to-speech (i.e., speech synthesis), text-to-music and text-to-sound
* Audio/Speech in LLMs/Multimodal LLMs
* Connection of audio generation with text generation, including similarities and differences.
* Video to Audio/Speech/Music Generation
* Multimodal generation of audio - going beyond unimodal inputs (text/video/audio) to audio — using multiple modalities for generating audio
* Data for audio/speech/music generative AI
* Generative methods for and it’s impact on established speech tasks such as speech enhancement, source separation, voice conversion, speech to speech translation, to mention a few
* Generation of spatial audio and experiences driven by spatial audio.
* Generation of audio for virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR)
* Synchronized Generation of audio along with visuals
* Impact of generative audio on media and content creation technologies
* Interpretability in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
* Responsibility in generative AI for audio/speech/music.
* Novel applications of audio/speech/music generation


We welcome submissions from researchers in academia and industry. The workshop will provide a platform for discussing the latest advances in the field and identifying future research directions.

We invite submission in two tracks, Main Paper Track and Demo Track. The submission  process and details are outlined below. Please reach out to the organizers for any questions/confusion.



## Main paper track

The main paper track is the primary submission track for the Audio Imagination workshop and will facilitate discussions on relevant topics. Accepted papers will be presented through oral talks or poster sessions. Please note that Audio Imagination is an in-person workshop and papers are expected to be presented in person.

Please do not submit papers previously published at any other conference/journal. Extensions of previously accepted/published (minor or major) of previously accepted/published works are welcome. We especially encourage and welcome papers discussing interesting early promising research and/or preliminary results. Short versions of Neurips 2024 submissions can be submitted to the workshop.
Authors of accepted papers can submit their work to another conference/journal, provided the other conference/journal allows it. Authors are responsible for ensuring they meet the submission policy of any other conference/journal.

Authors of papers accepted at Audio Imagination can submit their paper at another conference/journal provided the other conference/journal allows it. Please note that, authors are responsible for ensuring that they meet submission policy of any other conference/journal.


Papers submitted in the Main Paper Track

* Should be in Neurips 2024 format.  Please find Latex Style Files and Other Formatting Instructions from [Neurips submission page](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers)
* Up to a max of 5 pages of content, including all figures and tables.
* Should be double blind as per NeurIPS policy.


Paper will be submitted through Openreview. Openreview Submission Link - [Openreview Audio Imagination 2024](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/Audio_Imagination#tab-your-consoles)


## Demo track

A key component of the Audio Imagination workshop is that we will also hold a demo session, where participants will have a chance to showcase their advanced audio generation methods and technologies. The demo track will enable listening experiences for workshop participants which is critical to understand, evaluate and contextualize generated audio. The demo session will be conducted alongside poster sessions.

We invite submissions to the Demo Track. Submissions to Demo Track

* Should be in Neurips 2024 format.  Please find Latex Style Files and Other Formatting Instructions from Neurips Submission[Link to the Neurips page — https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers] Please use the [preprint] option in Neurips style.
* should be 2 pages of content, including all figures and tables.
* should clearly describe your demo and what participants will experience in your demo. A clear description of the overall demo setup is also expected.
* are single blind. Authors should put their names and affiliations.
* can also come from Main Paper Track. Authors of the Main Paper Track can indicate in their paper interest in giving a demo of their work.

Paper will be submitted through Openreview. Openreview Submission Link - Will be available on August 15.
